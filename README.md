Epidemic Models Simulation on Small-World Graphs
This repository contains Python code to simulate various epidemic models (SI, SIR, SIS, SIRS) on small-world graphs generated using the Watts-Strogatz model. The simulations explore how diseases spread through networks, considering different centrality measures.

Introduction
Understanding the dynamics of disease spread is crucial for public health interventions. Network models provide valuable insights into how diseases propagate through populations. This project investigates epidemic models on small-world graphs, focusing on nodes with high centrality measures.

Features
Simulations of SI, SIR, SIS, and SIRS epidemic models
Visualization of epidemic spread based on different centrality measures
Modular code structure for easy experimentation and extension
Utilizes NetworkX for graph manipulation and Matplotlib for visualization
